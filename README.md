# PyBlog
A repository containing source code that I use for creating online tutorials, blog posts, articles and e-books on different and several platforms. 

## First (Recommended Steps)

Whether you would like to explore all code or just one piece of code, I recommend you follow these steps below

- create a virtual environment 

`python -m venv my_env` 

Be sure to change `my_env` to whatever name you'd like for your VirtualEnvironment

- activate the environment

In the terminal or CMD type `cd my_env/Scripts/activate` 

Once that is a success, you are ready to install any package and build.

## Follow Installation Guide in Source-Code 

In every source-code included in this repository, every package required for the source to work will be highligted at the top level of the source file. 

Check the top comment highlighted using `***` at start and end. Copy and past sections into terminal or CMD
